# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This purpose of this project was to audit the election results of a recent local congressional election. This program does the following:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate von.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine the total number and percent of vote in each county.
7. Determine which County had the largest voter turnout.

## Election Audit Results
* There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.

* Of the 369,7111 votes cast in this election, Jefferson County accounted for 10.5% of the 
votes, with 38,855 votes cast. Denver County accounted for 82.8% of the votes cast in the election, with 306,055. The remaining 6.7% of the votes, or 34,801 votes, came from Arapahoe County. 

* As you can see Denver County accounted for by far the most votes cast in the election.

* There were three candidates on the ballot, Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. The candidates received 85,213, 272,892, and 11,606 votes respectively.

* As the vote totals indicate, Diana DeGette won the election, receiving ~74% of the popular vote. 

## Election Audit Summary
This script is able to process hundreds of thousands of votes in a matter of tenths of a second. A common criticism of mordern day elections is the delay in the casting of the votes to the votes being tallied and reported. By installing a program like this, any election data that is formatted for the program can be inputted and the results known almost instantaneously. The script is modular by nature and could be modified to do a number of things in addition to simply processing the results. If the results of the data is a larger scope than 3 counties, all that would need to be added would be another if statement and some variables to parse through, for instance, the state that the election took place in, or country even.
